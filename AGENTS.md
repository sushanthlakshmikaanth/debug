## Project Summary
A high-stakes debugging competition platform where users solve logical vulnerabilities in multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Go). The project features a gamified terminal aesthetic, real-time validation, and a competitive ranking system.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (Animations), Lucide React (Icons)
- **Components:** Shadcn UI
- **Database/Auth:** Supabase (Default preference)

## Architecture
- `src/app/`: Core routing and page logic
- `src/app/arena/`: The main debugging environment
- `src/components/ui/`: Reusable primitive components
- `src/lib/`: Utilities and hooks

## User Preferences
- No comments unless requested.
- High-octane, technical, "cyber" aesthetic (Matrix/Terminal style).
- Long, optimized landing pages with scroll-triggered animations.
- Clear attribution to "TSY CLUB - VEL TECH RANGA SANKU ARTS COLLEGE".

## Project Guidelines
- Maintain monospace typography for technical details.
- Use primary color (#primary) for accents and interactive elements.
- Ensure all UI elements feel responsive and "tactile" with hover effects.

## Common Patterns
- Bento grid layouts for features.
- Absolute background overlays for depth and visual interest.
- Framer Motion for entrance and scroll animations.
